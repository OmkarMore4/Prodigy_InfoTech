The Python-based Image Encryption and Decryption Tool ensures secure image storage and transmission. Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, the tool encrypts image files, making them accessible only with the correct key. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images securely using a user-defined key. The encryption ensures that image data remains confidential and can only be accessed with the correct key.<br><br>
üîê What is Image Encryption?<br>
Image encryption is a technique used to protect images by converting their pixel values into an unreadable format using a cryptographic algorithm. This project implements the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm, which provides strong security for image encryption and decryption.<br><br>
üîë AES Encryption Algorithm:<br>
AES is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that operates on blocks of data, ensuring high security and efficiency. It supports different key sizes, such as 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit.<br>
üîπ Encryption Process:<br>
‚Ä¢ Convert the image into byte format.<br>
‚Ä¢ Apply AES encryption using the user-defined key.<br>
‚Ä¢ Save the encrypted image in an unreadable format.<br>
üîπ Decryption Process:<br>
‚Ä¢ Load the encrypted image.<br>
‚Ä¢ Apply AES decryption using the same key.<br
‚Ä¢ Recover and display the original image.<br>
‚Ä¢ This method ensures that images remain secure while being reversible when the correct key is provided.<br><br>
