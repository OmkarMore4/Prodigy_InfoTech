The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it for military communications. It is a type of substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions to obtain the cipher text.<br>
The Python program implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm provides functionalities for both encryption and decryption, making it a simple yet effective cryptographic tool.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used<br>
This project is implemented using the following technologies:<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Programming Language:<br>
‚Ä¢ Python: Used for writing the core logic of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption functions.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Libraries Used:<br>
‚Ä¢ Tkinter ‚Äì Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encryption and decryption.<br>
‚Ä¢ string ‚Äì Provides access to standard character sets (alphabets) used in the encryption process.<br>
‚Ä¢ sys ‚Äì Enables command-line interaction and user input handling.<br>
‚Ä¢ argparse (optional enhancement) ‚Äì Can be used to handle command-line arguments for encrypting and decrypting text without manual input.

üöÄ Features of the Cipher Tool <br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Text Encryption<br>
‚Ä¢ Converts a given plaintext message into a coded format using a shift key.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Decryption<br>
‚Ä¢ Decodes a given encrypted message back to its original form.<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Customizable Shift Key<br>
‚Ä¢ Users can define their own shift value for encryption and decryption.<br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Case Sensitivity Handling<br>
‚Ä¢ Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypts All Characters<br>
‚Ä¢ Letters, numbers, punctuation, and symbols are encrypted.<br>
6Ô∏è‚É£ Maintains Message Structure<br>
‚Ä¢ Spaces and special characters are modified but preserved in position.<br>
7Ô∏è‚É£ Command-Line Interface (CLI)<br>
‚Ä¢ Allows users to input messages directly via the terminal.<br>
8Ô∏è‚É£ Graphical User Interface (GUI)<br>
‚Ä¢ Provides an interactive Tkinter-based interface for easier use.<br>
9Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability<br>
‚Ä¢ Can be modified to work with different languages and larger datasets.
